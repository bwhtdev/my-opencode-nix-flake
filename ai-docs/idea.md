# SourceCamp Project Vision

## Overview
SourceCamp is a modern, collaborative Git hosting platform designed to reimagine version control and code collaboration. Inspired by platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Gitea, it aims to provide an intuitive, skeuomorphic interface with a retro tech aesthetic, making code management feel engaging and addictive. The core goal is to foster seamless teamwork for developers, teams, and open-source communities by combining powerful features with a delightful user experience.

## Key Objectives
- **Accessibility and Usability**: Create an opinionated cozy platform for developers while offering advanced tools for experts. Emphasize native keyboard shortcuts, micro-animations, and responsive design to ensure a smooth experience across devices.
- **Collaboration Focus**: Enhance real-time collaboration through features like live code editing, integrated issue tracking, pull requests, and CI/CD pipelines. Promote community building with user profiles, activity feeds, and social elements like following and contributions tracking.
- **Customization and Themes**: Support multiple themes (e.g., Rose Pine, Tokyo Night) with light/dark modes, allowing users to personalize their workspace. Use a skeuomorphic design language to evoke a "comfy retro tech Apple vibe" for an immersive feel.
- **Performance and Security**: Built on a robust tech stack that follows `tech-stack.md`, ensure high performance, scalability, and security. Follow functional programming principles for maintainable, immutable code.

## Target Audience
- Individual developers seeking a personal Git host.
- Small to medium teams needing affordable, self-hosted collaboration tools.
- Open-source projects looking for customizable, community-driven alternatives to proprietary platforms.

## Unique Selling Points
- **Skeuomorphic UI with Micro-Animations**: Unlike flat designs in competitors, SourceCamp uses Rive-powered animations and retro elements to make interactions fun and intuitive.
- **Functional Programming Paradigm**: Enforces immutable variables and no loops for cleaner, more predictable codebases.
- **Easy Deployment**: Leverage Nix and Fly.io for simple setup, with Docker Compose for local development.
- **Extensibility**: Modular architecture allowing easy addition of themes, integrations, and features.

## Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: Core Git functionality, user authentication, and basic project management.
- **Phase 2**: Advanced collaboration tools (issues, PRs, actions).
- **Phase 3**: UI enhancements, themes, and performance optimizations.
- **Phase 4**: Community features, mobile apps, and enterprise options.

This vision references and builds upon the branding guidelines (`branding-guidelines.md`), UX mockups (`ux-mockup.md`), and tech stack (`tech-stack.md`) to create a cohesive, innovative platform.
